What you are making? 
We are making a weather monitor that will meausure the temperature and humidity of our surroundings. This information will be displayed on a screen.

Inspiration: Some of us have camping experience in areas without service, so a temperature monitor would be helpful to have to know what to wear for the day.

Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):
